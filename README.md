# Fill It Up (for WordPress)
Fill It Up for WordPress is a handy plugin to mass generate content &amp; users in WordPress.

By using Fill It Up you speed up the initial development process until actual, proper content is in place.

![Fill It Up v1.0.0 - Preview](https://cdn.joomlaworks.org/fillitup/assets/fill-it-up_v1.0.0_preview.png)


## Why?
Custom dummy content should not be hard to make. Unlike other solutions, you get to create your own set of dummy content and re-use them as you want.

It's what we like to call "curated sample data sets"!

In the future, we plan to release pre-built sets of definition files from other users, covering different types of dummy content (e.g. politics, cars, design, fashion, news etc.) for anyone to re-use and get from prototyping to a production ready WordPress site in hours, not days!


## Use it
1. Get the latest build, ready to upload to WordPress: http://www.joomlaworks.net/downloads/?f=jw_fillitup_for_wp-v1.0.0.zip
2. Edit the plugin's Settings and add this demo definition file: https://cdn.joomlaworks.org/fillitup/demo/900x600.json?upd
3. Go back to th plugin and hit "Generate content & users"
4. Adjust your settings and go!

Depending on the number of items you choose to generate, it will take from a few seconds to a few minutes to complete, so be patient. You'll see a success message when the process is complete.

***Enjoy and share it :)***
